[{"name":"Admiral Swiggins","backstory":"Raised in the Swiggins Navy Family on the Kraken planet Titan. Charles Swiggins was the youngest of 30 siblings. Graduating from Wet Point with top honors, he quickly rose through the ranks to become Captain of his very first ship in the Royal Fleet. This ship was called the ‘Sweet Homboldt’.\n\nTasked with finding and defeating Pirates, Swiggins set out with a loyal crew on many succesfull sortees. One day, the Homboldt chanced upon the massive Pirateship 'Colossus' helmed by the dreaded Captain Inkbeard!\n\nAfter a furious battle, which reduced both ships to floating heaps of debris, the two captains were the only ones alive for a final showdown. Being nearly overpowered, Swiggins' grasping tentacle found a chain just below the surface of the churning water. Powered by his desperation he hurled the object at his foe. This object was Sweet Homboldts anchor! With one massive blow, Swiggins ended the biggest Pirate threat on Titan once and for all.\n\nNow an Admiral, he has exchanged the seas for the voids of space where his fame and leadership skills have found him a contract among the Awesomenauts!","stats":{"health":155,"healthBonus":30,"moveSpeed":6.8,"attackType":"Melee","role":["Fighter","Initiator","Crowd_Control"],"mobility":"Tactical"},"skills":[{"name":"Anchor Hook","description":"Swiggins hurls Homboldt forward, and grapples towards whatever he hits.

The couple grew fearful, however, when suspicious things started happening around the house: evil drawings on the wall, weird sounds at night and dead rapper frogs in the garden.\nWhen they finally figured out Ayla's \"gifts\" and dark sense of humor, they turned her over to the Sunny-daisy School of Social Re-adjustment. A few short days and several fires later, she got transferred to a maximum security psychiatric ward where she went berserk and chose the nearest wall for her stage exit.\nUsing her cute puppy-dog eye routine she managed to hitchhike her way across the galaxy and ended up with the Awesomenauts who, after her tantrums left half the ship in ruins, couldn't wait to get her in a droppod and away from their precious belongings.
