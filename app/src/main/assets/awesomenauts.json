    "backstory": "Raised in the Swiggins Navy Family on the Kraken planet Titan. Charles Swiggins was the youngest of 30 siblings. Graduating from Wet Point with top honors, he quickly rose through the ranks to become Captain of his very first ship in the Royal Fleet. This ship was called the ‘Sweet Homboldt’.\n\nTasked with finding and defeating Pirates, Swiggins set out with a loyal crew on many succesfull sortees. One day, the Homboldt chanced upon the massive Pirateship 'Colossus' helmed by the dreaded Captain Inkbeard!\n\nAfter a furious battle, which reduced both ships to floating heaps of debris, the two captains were the only ones alive for a final showdown. Being nearly overpowered, Swiggins' grasping tentacle found a chain just below the surface of the churning water. Powered by his desperation he hurled the object at his foe. This object was Sweet Homboldts anchor! With one massive blow, Swiggins ended the biggest Pirate threat on Titan once and for all.\n\nNow an Admiral, he has exchanged the seas for the voids of space where his fame and leadership skills have found him a contract among the Awesomenauts!",

User Channfree's Admiral Swiggins was chosen.\nAnother contest was later made to decide how Admiral Swiggins would look. Once again, the community was able to send in their entries, showcasing many different depictions of the character. In the end, user coffeybean4 won the contest with the design seen below."

Her parents were killed during the great Sevenelevian Coupon Wars and she was adopted by a sweet alien family. The couple grew fearful, however, when suspicious things started happening around the house: evil drawings on the wall, weird sounds at night and dead rapper frogs in the garden.\n\nWhen they finally figured out Ayla's \"gifts\" and dark sense of humor, they turned her over to the Sunny-daisy School of Social Re-adjustment. A few short days and several fires later, she got transferred to a maximum security psychiatric ward where she went berserk and chose the nearest wall for her stage exit.\n\nUsing her cute puppy-dog eye routine she managed to hitchhike her way across the galaxy and ended up with the Awesomenauts who, after her tantrums left half the ship in ruins, couldn't wait to get her in a droppod and away from their precious belongings. Still, she's a cherished member of the group, requiring only a gold-star sticker for her efforts on the field of battle!",

Originally created as part of a robot army to combat an immensely powerful super villain terrorizing the outer star systems, Clunk found himself without a job when the villain accidentally died of a nasty bacterial infection before the robot army was completed.\n\nThis was actually a blessing in disguise for Clunk, since he was never designed to return in one piece from his mission. He was refitted to do standard house-keeping work, but soon found himself out of work once more as he kept blowing aggression inhibitors and subsequently went into immensely destrucive tantrums.\n\nEventually, Clunk signed up as a mercenary to do what he is best at: wrecking things. He found that finally giving in to his aggressive nature has given him great inner peace. Nowadays he takes great pleasure in jetting around the battlefield, blowing up in peoples' faces to the sound of heavy metal.",

      "When using either Missile Barrage, The Juggernaut \"Fat Pete\" or Salvo Value Pack, it is possible to keep track of your launch string. That way, you can store a more powerful missile just before a teamfight. These upgrades also stack, meaning Clunk can fire two missiles at once."

In fact he lacks any kind of smarts, managing to get his IQ rated under the level of plankton in the official galaxial IQ test.\n\nNevertheless Derpl is the heir apparent to Blabl's galaxy-spanning business empire. This is something that doesn't sit well with Blabl, not well at all. Dreading the day Derpl would inherit the company and run all the hardfought accomplishments into the ground, Blabl put Derpl in charge of fieldtesting the new Specialized Universal Secretary Interface (S.U.S.I. for short) in one of Zork Industries' combat walkers. Asking Derpl what form of devastation should be issued forth from his vehicle of destruction he simply drooled and said: \"I wuv cats!\"\n\nNow Blabl is anxiously awaiting the day that Derpl would suffer a fatal blow on the fields of battle but as of yet Derpl's combat walker has proven to keep making up for its dimwitted driver.",

Growing up in the baddest part of town, struggle and incarceration surrounded Froggy from an early age. Taking part in his first swim-by shootout as a tadpole, Froggy seemed destined for a life of crime and prison.\n\nAfter a bloody gangwar with the neighbouring Toad-unit posse ended in a 5 year jail sentence, Froggy G vowed to end his gangsta ways. Instead, Froggy G started earning his keep as a beatboxing streetdancer and rapper, hoping to be picked up by a major record label. Unfortunately, his tracks titled \"Pond Pimpin\", \"Froggin' dirty\" and \"Motherfrogger bounce!\" didn't earn him much.\n\nIn order to make some money, and then make some mo', Froggy G became a hired gun. Combining his shoot-out experiences with lethal watery dance-moves and beatboxing techniques, Froggy G now spins and dashes across intergalactic battlefields, droppin foo's left and right with his fishgun, hoping to make some money to take his momma out of the hood.",

But Gnaw was not a beast that could be caged: his acid-breath melted his holding pen and Gnaw started to rampage through the science facility where he was held. No-one knows exactly what happened, but the facility was found 12 days later, abandoned, and overgrown with some weird, toxic flora.\n\nGnaw was eventually noticed by a passing band of Amphibian cosmic bikerpirates. Gnaw was in need of some friends, and he was taken in by them, nurtured and trained to fight in black-market exotic-alien arena fights. Occasionally his masters sell Gnaw's \"services\" to any war general that is desperate enough to set loose the rapid, chitinous menace upon the battlefield.",

He lost his arm in a unfortunate jeu de boules incident and spends most of his time smoothly escaping debt collectors. He found himself breaking into the bedroom of the prime minister's wife, while looking for the wine cellar.\n\nHe knew no amount of charm could save him this time and planned his escape, which was eventually delayed because he refused to escape in anything but a space yacht.\n\nLeon joined the Awesomenauts for some quick cash, spending it on beautiful women and exquisite meals. In combat, he puts his natural reptile abilities to some good use and slices up his enemies with great precision. Combat is a form of art for this green gentleman.",

      "Using Cheese & Garlic Mints can give Leon a very powerful initiation tool: not only will your enemies be pulled towards your team, but they will also be unable to use any escaping/defensive abilities they might have.",
      "If you don't have Basic AI Chip, leaving a clone inside a hide area will grant vision to you and your teamates.",
      "Backstab Blade cannot affect turrets of the Solar drill, but the animation for a successful strike will still play. Don't be fooled by this.",
      "One of the first abilities you will want to upgrade if you want to maximize your DPS against droids and 'nauts is your Backstab Blade. It will help you tremendously, since you will almost always get a backstab or two on your first strike, and you will get a lot more if they start to run away. However, if your goal is to have high overall damage and be effective against turrets, Chainsaw Addon is a better option.",
      "If you're actively in an engagement and have Surprise Party Mask upgraded, quickly cloak and uncloak for a higher damage slash.",
      "Always make sure to go around crossfire while cloaked, you might be invisible but enemy projectiles and area of effect damage are still issues. It is very easy to be nailed by a lone dynamite and immediately killed.",
      "When you're stalking an enemy, if you see him start to attack a turret, sneak up from behind him, stand still, and wail on him. This will keep him trapped between you and the turret for a short period of time, maybe until he dies, if he doesn't realize that you are standing in the way quickly enough.",
      "Jumping around an enemy will let you avoid a lot of unneeded damage. If you have the Backstab Blade equpped, jump behind them repeatedly to boost your damage output tremendously.",
      "Combining a fully upgraded Surprise Party Mask, Backstab Blade, and Chainsaw Addon will result in an uncloaking backstab that does high damage. If they're hurt, this can easily take them out.",
      "Pull enemies into dangerous situations with your Tongue. Good places are into your teammates, Yuri's mines, or your turrets.",
      "If you are trying to destroy a turret with no support from allied 'nauts/creeps, cloak directly in front of the turret to use it as a temporary shield.",
      "The orb on Aiguillon works with Leon's Surprise Party Mask just like normal cloak. A popular combo is getting the orb, uncloaking with a slash, activating cloaking skin and then slashing the enemy again for high amounts of damage. The orb does not grant Pinot Noir, however.",
      "With either Aggressive AI Chip or Blow Up Doll, Leon is able to push two lanes at once. Simply leave a clone in one lane close to enemy droids and push the other lane yourself. Using Basic AI Chip makes this tactic more efficient."
    ],
    "tipsPlayingAgainst": [
      "Even when Leon's invisible it's still possible to hear his footsteps. Some players turn off the game music and increase sound effects volume for this sole purpose.",
      "Jumping erratically around Leon may be useful when trying to evade Tongue Snatch.",
      "Any visual indicators coming from Leon's enemies (damage numbers, crowd control effects, Raelynn's Snipe targeting reticle and damage over time effects) will show up on Leon even if he's invisible. Use that to find him.",
      "The cooldown on Leon's Cloaking Skin doesn't start until invisibility is broken. If you see him uncloaking, keep in mind that you have a few seconds to attack or even kill him before he can cloak again.",
      "Don't let the minimap fool you! Leon's clones appear as a 'naut there.",
      "If Leon is using a clonespam loadout (which involves sending clones to attack your turrets over and over), keep in mind that his cloak will most likely be unavaliable when you find him. It could be a good idea to either kill him or force him away.",
      "Clones with Basic AI Chip and Aggressive AI Chip will chase the nearest target. Use this to lure them away from your turret."

After highschool she went straight into the E.L.F. army to fight against the invading robots, just before the first AI war.\n\nShe was trained by the best and excelled in long range weaponary. Within a year she was given the honor of joining an elite squad called the SkyHawks, where she met the love of her life: her Pulserifle \"Cuddles\".\n\nFor years they did covert missions together as a team to disrupt robot production and steal robot technologies. They were feared by all robots (well...the ones with emo-chips).\n\nUntil that one deep space mission to AI station 404 in the year 3009, where she ran into a robot ambush, and \"Cuddles\" was brutally taken away from her. Raelynn was put into cryostasis. Decades passed until a small mercenary team found her hidden on the planet. There she was rejoined with \"Cuddles\" and many warm 'hugs' were given that day to all robots on 404.",

      "Most of Raelynn's playstyles involves keeping her enemies at a safe distance. Denny's Boots and Gryc Lubricator may help her accomplish that.",
      "Remember: the laser sight for Raelynn's Snipe becomes yellow when you are targetting an enemy Awesomenaut. This is specially useful when using the Gryc Lubricator upgrade for offscreen kills. Watching the minimap also helps in these cases.",
      "When charging up Snipe, it is possible to press the Snipe button a second time after hearing the beep to fire the beam earlier.",
      "Aiming Snipe away from your enemy or at the ground can prevent them from seeing the laser sight right away. Quickly direct it to your enemies and fire, surprising them.",
      "You can begin charging Snipe while Raelynn is mid-air. Jump from a high place and activate it. By the time you hit the ground, Snipe will likely be ready to fire, giving less reaction time to your enemies.",
      "Iron Rifle can prevent many crowd control effects from interrupting Snipe.",
      "When using Laserpointer, sweeping the area in front of you in a fan-like motion may help you in blinding more enemies with it.",
      "Timerift is a very effective tool against sieged Derpls as it affects the unsiege animation, making it way longer. Some players may notice this and will start sieging on glass platforms so they can drop down and escape, however.",
      "Despite what it may look like, Timerift isn't a slow, but a [Slowdown]] and, as such, isn't affected by CC reduction or CC immunity.",
      "With the T-800 Dome upgrade for Timerift, it is possible to solo turrets very effectively if they are left unguarded by your enemy",
      "Without the Higgs Grenade upgrade, Timerift is best used to block chokepoints.",
      "If taking HC-Bomb, it's best to attempt to trap enemies in Timerift and use your HC-shots to whittle them down until you're able to finish them off with Snipe. Using Gryc Lubricator helps to finish off fleeing enemies very well."
    ],
    "tipsPlayingAgainst": [
      "Snipe can be interrupted by most crowd control effects, and will go on cooldown if this happens.",
      "Snipe can't go through terrain. Stay out of Raelynn's direct line of sight to discourage her from firing it.",
      "Before engaging an enemy Raelynn, make sure you will be able to kill her quickly. She may get you low enough on health so that her Snipe will finish you off.",
      "Saving abilities that are harder to land for when Raelynn uses Snipe might be a good idea, as she can't move until the she fires the beam or is interrupted.",
      "The cooldown on Timerift exceeds its duration. This is true even with the 1.21 Gigawatt Battery upgrade. You can use that window of opportunity to approach a Raelynn, but be mindful of Snipe as well.",
      "Raelynn's Protoblaster can deal high dps with proper upgrades. Don't underestimate her ability to engage in close combat."
