[{"name":"Admiral Swiggins","backstory":"Raised in the Swiggins Navy Family on the Kraken planet Titan. Charles Swiggins was the youngest of 30 siblings. Graduating from Wet Point with top honors, he quickly rose through the ranks to become Captain of his very first ship in the Royal Fleet. This ship was called the ‘Sweet Homboldt’.\n\nTasked with finding and defeating Pirates, Swiggins set out with a loyal crew on many succesfull sortees. One day, the Homboldt chanced upon the massive Pirateship 'Colossus' helmed by the dreaded Captain Inkbeard!\n\nAfter a furious battle, which reduced both ships to floating heaps of debris, the two captains were the only ones alive for a final showdown. Being nearly overpowered, Swiggins' grasping tentacle found a chain just below the surface of the churning water. Powered by his desperation he hurled the object at his foe. This object was Sweet Homboldts anchor! With one massive blow, Swiggins ended the biggest Pirate threat on Titan once and for all.\n\nNow an Admiral, he has exchanged the seas for the voids of space where his fame and leadership skills have found him a contract among the Awesomenauts!","stats":{"health":155,"healthBonus":30,"moveSpeed":6.8,"attackType":"Melee","role":["Fighter","Initiator","Crowd_Control"],"mobility":"Tactical"},"skills":[{"name":"Anchor Hook","description":"Swiggins hurls Homboldt forward, and grapples towards whatever he hits.
